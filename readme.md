Bastards, Thieves and Pirates
=============================

**A single-player browser-based space strategy game.**

It's space combat through a scanner (darkly).

Fire your lasers, shoot your photo torpedoes, send all power to the shields, keep an eye on the numbers, watch the hull damage.

Your ship
---------

It's called The Heavy Hawk. It can warp a large distance when the warp drive is charged. It has a *hull* which can be damaged. If hull reaches 0 - game over, man. It has different sections which can be damaged individually. These sections influence how well your ship dodges, shoots, charges etc.
